### Homeworks and Practices 

## Practice 1.
### Discrete and continuous membership functions

<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop a code that can generate and trace membership functions based on specified parameters, considering their main characteristics.</p>
<h2>Development:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Analyze the main characteristics of the functions.</li>
  <li>Define the necessary steps to generate the membership functions.</li>
  <li>Establish conditions for each parameter to meet the specifications.</li>
  <li>Design a code in the "m" language to represent the functions separately.</li>
  <li>Display the results and compare them with theoretical knowledge.</li>
  <li>Combine the different diagrams to fulfill the request.</li>
  <li>Analyze the results and identify the characteristics studied.</li>
  <li>Draw conclusions by comparing the results with the main objective.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results:</h2>

## Practice 2.
### Fuzzy Operations

<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>Calculate and graph the operations complement, union, intersection, and Morgan's laws of fuzzy sets in the given universe.</p>
<h2>Development:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>It is very important to be introduced to the subject to understand the concepts and rules of the basic operations of fuzzy sets.</li>
  <li>Later it was very helpful for me to know Zadeh's theorems to see the different ways in which the operations could be approached.</li>
  <li>Once contextualized, the coding begins by assigning the value of the variables (fuzzy sets), the universe and the corresponding operations. </li>
  <li>Subsequently, the results of each operation are plotted, following the given instructions.</li>
  <li>It is compared if the results obtained are practically coherent with the theoretical part, both analytically and visually.</li>
</ol>
