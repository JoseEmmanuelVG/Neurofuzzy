### Homeworks and Practices 

## Practice 1

<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop a code that can generate and trace membership functions based on specified parameters, considering their main characteristics.</p>
<h2>Development:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Analyze the main characteristics of the functions.</li>
  <li>Define the necessary steps to generate the membership functions.</li>
  <li>Establish conditions for each parameter to meet the specifications.</li>
  <li>Design a code in the "m" language to represent the functions separately.</li>
  <li>Display the results and compare them with theoretical knowledge.</li>
  <li>Combine the different diagrams to fulfill the request.</li>
  <li>Analyze the results and identify the characteristics studied.</li>
  <li>Draw conclusions by comparing the results with the main objective.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results:</h2>
