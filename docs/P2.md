## Fuzzy Operations

<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>Calculate and graph the operations complement, union, intersection, and Morgan's laws of fuzzy sets in the given universe.</p>
<h2>Development:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>It is very important to be introduced to the subject to understand the concepts and rules of the basic operations of fuzzy sets.</li>
  <li>Later it was very helpful for me to know Zadeh's theorems to see the different ways in which the operations could be approached.</li>
  <li>Once contextualized, the coding begins by assigning the value of the variables (fuzzy sets), the universe and the corresponding operations. </li>
  <li>Subsequently, the results of each operation are plotted, following the given instructions.</li>
  <li>It is compared if the results obtained are practically coherent with the theoretical part, both analytically and visually.</li>
</ol>
